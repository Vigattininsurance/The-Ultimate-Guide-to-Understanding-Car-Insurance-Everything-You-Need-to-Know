Why Should I Have Car Insurance?
Car insurance may seem like just an additional expense to you. You will realize that you are paying for something that you cannot use for a year. Making no auto insurance claims over the past year indicates you drove safely. While driving safely last year doesn't guarantee you won't experience any accidents this year.

You can receive two significant advantages from car insurance coverage; financial and liability protection. By utilizing this, you make sure that in the event of an accident, your hard-earned money will be returned. Even in the event that a third party is hurt in the accident and requires medical attention, you are spared from having to cover all costs out of your own money.
Factors Affecting the Price of Car Insurance
Insurance companies use statistics to identify high-risk drivers. They impose higher premiums on drivers who may pose a greater risk. Below are some typical ranking criteria.

Age
Rates are highest for new drivers. As the driver gains experience, the insurance becomes relatively cheaper. Later in life, rates start to rise once more. For instance, a senior citizen motorist might face charges comparable to those of a young driver just getting their license.

Type of Vehicle
Insurance also depends on the kind and brand of the vehicle. Your insurance premiums will increase if you drive a vehicle with a high value. Also, if you drive a sports car rather than a minivan, your expenditures will be higher.

Claims History
Insurance companies also consider if you've previously made auto insurance claims as well as the nature of those claims. If you submit claims regularly, your rate will probably increase.

Credit Score
Insurance companies take your credit scores into account when calculating your auto insurance rates. Your vehicle insurance rate will typically be lower the higher your credit score.
